A computer algebra system (CAS) has the ability to manipulate mathematical
expressions in a way similar to the traditional manual computations of
mathematicians and scientists.

The symbolic manipulations supported include:

- simplification to a smaller expression or some standard form,
  including automatic simplification with assumptions and
  simplification with constraints
- substitution of symbols or numeric values for certain expressions
- change of form of expressions: expanding products and powers, partial
  and full factorization, rewriting as partial fractions, constraint
  satisfaction, rewriting trigonometric functions as exponentials,
  transforming logic expressions, etc.
- partial and total differentiation
- matrix operations including products, inverses, etc.
- statistical computation
- optimized code generation
