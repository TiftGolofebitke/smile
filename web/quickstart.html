    <p>Smile is a fast and comprehensive machine learning system.
        With advanced data structures and algorithms, Smile delivers the state-of-art performance.
        Smile is self contained and requires only Java standard library.
        Since v1.4, Smile may optionally leverage native BLAS/LAPACK library too.
        It also provides high-level operators in Scala and an interactive shell.
        In practice, data scientists usually build models with high-level tools such as R, Matlab,
        SAS, etc. However, developers have to spend a lot of time and energy to incorporate these
        models in the production system that are often implemented in general purpose programming
        languages such as Java and Scala. With Smile, data scientists and developers can work
        in the same environment to build machine learning applications quickly!</p>

    <h2 id="download">Download</h2>

    <p>Get Smile from the <a href="https://github.com/haifengl/smile/releases">releases page</a> of
        the project website. We provide pre-packaged binary for Mac. The universal tarball
        is also available and can be used on Windows and Linux.</p>

    <p>If you would like to build Smile from source, please first install Java 8, Scala 2.13
        and SBT 1.0+. Then clone the repo and build the package:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><code>
    git clone https://github.com/haifengl/smile.git
    cd smile
    sbt package
    </code></pre>

    <p>To build with Scala 2.12, run</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><code>
    sbt ++2.12.10 scala/package
    </code></pre>

    <p>To test the latest code, run the following</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><code>
    git pull
    ./smile.sh
    </code></pre>

    <p>which will build the system and enter the shell.</p>

    <p>Smile runs on both Windows (requires Windows Subsystem for Linux)
        and UNIX-like systems (e.g. Linux, Mac OS).
        All you need is to have <code>Java 8</code> installed on your system <code>PATH</code>,
        or the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable pointing to a Java installation.</p>

    <h2 id="shell">Shell</h2>

    <p>Smile comes with an interactive shell. In the home directory of Smile, type</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><code>
    ./bin/smile
    </code></pre>

    <p>to enter the shell, which is based on <a href="http://ammonite.io">Ammonite REPL</a>.
        In the shell, you can run any valid Scala expressions.
        In the simplest case, you can use it as a calculator.
        Besides, all high-level Smile operators are predefined
        in the shell. Be default, the shell uses up to 4GB memory. If you need more memory
        to handle large data, use the option <code>-J-Xmx</code>. For example,</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><code>
    ./bin/smile -J-Xmx8192M
    </code></pre>

    <p>You can also modify the configuration file <code>./conf/smile.ini</code>
        for the memory and other JVM settings.</p>

    <h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

    <p>When the shell starts, we should see something like the following:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
                                                       ..::''''::..
                                                     .;''        ``;.
     ....                                           ::    ::  ::    ::
   ,;' .;:                ()  ..:                  ::     ::  ::     ::
   ::.      ..:,:;.,:;.    .   ::   .::::.         :: .:' ::  :: `:. ::
    '''::,   ::  ::  ::  `::   ::  ;:   .::        ::  :          :  ::
  ,:';  ::;  ::  ::  ::   ::   ::  ::,::''.         :: `:.      .:' ::
  `:,,,,;;' ,;; ,;;, ;;, ,;;, ,;;, `:,,,,:'          `;..``::::''..;'
                                                       ``::,,,,::''

  Welcome to Smile Shell; enter 'help&lt;RETURN&gt;' for list of supported commands.
  Type "exit&lt;RETURN&gt;" to leave the Smile Shell
  Version 2.0.0, Scala 2.13.1, SBT 1.2.8, Built at 2019-11-20 20:04:41.868
===============================================================================
smile&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <strong>smile&gt;</strong> line is the prompt that the shell is waiting for you to enter expressions.
        To get help information of Smile high-level operators,
        type <code>help</code>. You can also get detailed information on
        each operator by typing <code>help("command")</code>, e.g.
        <code>help("svm")</code>. To exit the shell, type <code>exit</code>.</p>

    <p>In the shell, type <code>demo</code> to bring up the demo window,
        which shows off various Smile's machine learning capabilities.</p>

    <p>You can also type <code>benchmark()</code> to see Smile's performance
        on a couple of test data. You can run a particular benchmark by
        <code>bencharm("test name")</code>, where test name could be "airline",
        "usps", etc.</p>

    <p>On startup, the shell analyzes the classpath and creates a database of every visible package and path.
        This is available via tab-completion analogous to the path-completion available in most shells.
        If you type a partial path, tab will complete as far as it can and show you your options
        if there is more than one.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile&gt; smile.classification.r
    randomDecisionForest   rbfnet   rda
    </code></pre>

    <h3 id="third-party-libraries">Third Party Libraries</h3>

    <p>It is also possible to use third party libraries from Maven Central.
        For example,</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile&gt; import $ivy.`com.google.guava:guava:18.0`, com.google.common.collect._
    </code></pre>

    <p>If the library is not available in local ivy cache, Smile Shell will download
        it automatically. Note that the format <code>org:library:version</code> is similar
        with the library dependency in SBT. For Scala library, it is recommended to use
        the format <code>org::library:version</code>, which will choose the library in the
        same Scala major version (e.g. 2.13 vs 2.12).</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile&gt; import $ivy.`org.scalaz::scalaz-core:7.2.7`, scalaz._, Scalaz._
    </code></pre>

    <p>Beyond the default resolvers, we can add third-party or our own repositories:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile&gt; interp.repositories() ++= Seq(coursier.ivy.IvyRepository.fromPattern(
      "https://ambiata-oss.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/" +:
      coursier.ivy.Pattern.default
    ))
    </code></pre>

    <h3 id="calculator">Calculator</h3>

    <p>Smile Shell is based on <a href="http://ammonite.io">Ammonite REPL</a>. We can run any valid Scala
        expressions in the shell. In the simplest case, you can use it as a calculator.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile&gt; "Hello, World"
    res0: String = Hello, World

    smile&gt; 2
    res1: Int = 2

    smile&gt; 2+3
    res2: Int = 5
    </code></pre>

    <p>We can also define variables and reuse them.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile&gt; val x = 2 + 3
    x: Int = 5

    smile&gt; print(x)
    5

    smile&gt; val y = 2 * (x + 1)
    z: Int = 12
    </code></pre>

    <p>Functions can be defined too. As Scala is a functional language, functions are
        first class citizen, just like other values.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    smile&gt; def sq(x: Double) = x * x
    sq: (x: Double)Double

    smile&gt; sq(y)
    res4: Double = 441.0
    </code></pre>
    <p>Scala is a powerful and complicated language that fuses object-oriented programming and functional programming.
        Although you don't need to know all the bells and whistles of Scala to use Smile, we strongly recommend you to
        learn some <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/">basics</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="script">Script</h3>

    <p>We may also run Smile code in a script. The script
        <code>examples/iris.sc</code> containing the following Smile code</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    val data = read.arff(Paths.getTestData("weka/iris.arff"))
    println(data)

    val formula = "class" ~
    val rf = smile.classification.randomForest(formula, data)
    println(s"OOB error = %.2f%%" format 100 * rf.error)
    </code></pre>

    <p>can be run directly from the shell:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><code>
    $ bin/smile examples/iris.sc
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this example, we use Fisher's Iris data in the <code>data</code> directory
        (including many open data for research purpose). The data
        is in Weka's ARFF format. The function <code>read.arff</code> returns an object of
        <code>DataFrame</code>. The formula <code>"class" ~ </code> defines that
        the column "class" will be used as the class label while the rest columns
        are predictors. Finally, we train a random forest
        with default parameters and print out its OOB (out of bag) error. We can apply
        the model on new data samples with the method <code>predict</code>.</p>
