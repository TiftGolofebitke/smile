/** Multidimensional scaling. MDS is a set of related statistical techniques
  * often used in information visualization for exploring similarities or
  * dissimilarities in data. An MDS algorithm starts with a matrix of item-item
  * similarities, then assigns a location to each item in N-dimensional space.
  * For sufficiently small N, the resulting locations may be displayed in a
  * graph or 3D visualization.
  *
  * The major types of MDS algorithms include:
  *
  * '''Classical multidimensional scaling'''
  * takes an input matrix giving dissimilarities between pairs of items and
  * outputs a coordinate matrix whose configuration minimizes a loss function
  * called strain.
  *
  * '''Metric multidimensional scaling''' is
  * a superset of classical MDS that generalizes the optimization procedure
  * to a variety of loss functions and input matrices of known distances with
  * weights and so on. A useful loss function in this context is called stress
  * which is often minimized using a procedure called stress majorization.
  *
  * '''Non-metric multidimensional scaling''' finds both a non-parametric
  * monotonic relationship between the dissimilarities in the item-item matrix
  * and the Euclidean distances between items, and the location of each item in
  * the low-dimensional space. The relationship is typically found using isotonic
  * regression.
  *
  * '''Generalized multidimensional scaling''' is
  * an extension of metric multidimensional scaling, in which the target
  * space is an arbitrary smooth non-Euclidean space. In case when the
  * dissimilarities are distances on a surface and the target space is another
  * surface, GMDS allows finding the minimum-distortion embedding of one surface
  * into another.
