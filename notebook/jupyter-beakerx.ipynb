    "Most Smile algorithms take simple `double[]` as input. But we often use the encapsulation class AttributeDataset. In fact, the output of most Smile data parsers is an `AttributeDataset` object. `AttributeDataset` contains a fixed number of attributes. All attribute values are stored as double even if the attribute may be nominal, ordinal, string, or date. The dataset is stored row-wise internally, which is fast for frequently accessing instances of dataset.\n",

    "A data object may have an associated class label (for classification) or real-valued response value (for regression). Optionally, a data object or attribute may have a (positive) weight value, whose meaning depends on applications.

    "## Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning and pattern recognition, classification refers to an algorithmic procedure for assigning a given input object into one of a given number of categories. The input object is formally termed an instance, and the categories are termed classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification normally refers to a supervised procedure, i.e. a procedure that produces an inferred function to predict the output value of new instances based on a training set of pairs consisting of an input object and a desired output value. The inferred function is called a classifier if the output is discrete or a regression function if the output is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inferred function should predict the correct output value for any valid input object. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a \"reasonable\" way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wide range of supervised learning algorithms is available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems. The most widely used learning algorithms are AdaBoost and gradient boosting, support vector machines, linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and neural networks (multilayer perceptron).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the feature vectors include features of many different kinds (discrete, discrete ordered, counts, continuous values), some algorithms cannot be easily applied. Many algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and nearest neighbor methods, require that the input features be numerical and scaled to similar ranges (e.g., to the `[-1,1]` interval). Methods that employ a distance function, such as nearest neighbor methods and support vector machines with Gaussian kernels, are particularly sensitive to this. An advantage of decision trees (and boosting algorithms based on decision trees) is that they easily handle heterogeneous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input features contain redundant information (e.g., highly correlated features), some learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, and distance based methods) will perform poorly because of numerical instabilities. These problems can often be solved by imposing some form of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If each of the features makes an independent contribution to the output, then algorithms based on linear functions (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, linear support vector machines, naive Bayes) generally perform well. However, if there are complex interactions among features, then algorithms such as nonlinear support vector machines, decision trees and neural networks work better. Linear methods can also be applied, but the engineer must manually specify the interactions when using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smile's classification algorithms are in the package `smile.classification` and all algorithms implement the interface `Classifier` that has a method `predict` to predict the class label of an instance. An overloaded version in `SoftClassifier` can also calculate the a posteriori probabilities besides the class label. For all algorithms, the model can be trained through the constructor. Meanwhile, each algorithm has a `Trainer` companion class that can hold model hyper-parameters and be applied to multiple training datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms with online learning capability also implement the interface `OnlineClassifier`. Online learning is a model of induction that learns one instance at a time. The method learn updates the model with a new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) is a method for classifying objects by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its `k` nearest neighbors (`k` is typically small). k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification."

    "\n",
    "  - If the number of cases in the training set is `N`, randomly sample `N` cases with replacement from the original data. This sample will be the training set for growing the tree.\n",
    "  - If there are `M` input variables, a number `m` << `M` is specified such that at each node, `m` variables are selected at random out of the `M` and the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of `m` is held constant during the forest growing.\n",

    "    \n",
    "where ntrees is the number of trees, and mtry is the number of attributed randomly selected at each node to choose the best split. Although the original random forest algorithm trains each tree fully without pruning, it is useful to control the tree size some times, which can be achieved by the parameter maxNodes. The tree can also be regularized by limiting the minimum number of observations in trees' terminal nodes with the parameter nodeSize. When subsample = 1.0, we use the sampling with replacement to train each tree as described above. If subsample < 1.0, we instead select a subset of samples (without replacement) to train each tree. If the classes are not balanced, the user should provide the classWeight (proportional to the class priori) so that the sampling is done in stratified way. Otherwise, small classes may be not sampled sufficiently."

    "\n",
    "The nonlinear SVMs are created by applying the kernel trick to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The resulting algorithm is formally similar, except that every dot product is replaced by a nonlinear kernel function. This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and the transformed space be high dimensional. For example, the feature space corresponding Gaussian kernel is a Hilbert space of infinite dimension. Thus though the classifier is a hyperplane in the high-dimensional feature space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space. Maximum margin classifiers are well regularized, so the infinite dimension does not spoil the results.\n",
    "\n",

Each node calculates a transformed weighted linear combination of its inputs (output activations from the preceding layer), with one of the weights acting as a trainable bias connected to a constant input. The transformation, called activation function, is a bounded non-decreasing (non-linear) function, such as the sigmoid functions (ranges from `0` to `1`). Another popular activation function is hyperbolic tangent which is actually equivalent to the sigmoid function in shape but ranges from `-1` to `1`. More specialized activation functions include radial basis functions which are used in RBF networks.\n",

    "Hierarchical algorithms find successive clusters using previously established clusters. These algorithms usually are either agglomerative (\"bottom-up\") or divisive (\"top-down\"). Agglomerative algorithms begin with each element as a separate cluster and merge them into successively larger clusters. Divisive algorithms begin with the whole set and proceed to divide it into successively smaller clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitional algorithms typically determine all clusters at once, but can also be used as divisive algorithms in the hierarchical clustering. Many partitional clustering algorithms require the specification of the number of clusters to produce in the input data set, prior to execution of the algorithm. Barring knowledge of the proper value beforehand, the appropriate value must be determined, a problem on its own for which a number of techniques have been developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based clustering algorithms are devised to discover arbitrary-shaped clusters. In this approach, a cluster is regarded as a region in which the density of data objects exceeds a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subspace clustering methods look for clusters that can only be seen in a particular projection (subspace, manifold) of the data. These methods thus can ignore irrelevant attributes. The general problem is also known as Correlation clustering while the special case of axis-parallel subspaces is also known as two-way clustering, co-clustering or biclustering in bioinformatics: in these methods not only the objects are clustered but also the features of the objects, i.e., if the data is represented in a data matrix, the rows and columns are clustered simultaneously. They usually do not however work with arbitrary feature combinations as in general subspace methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters in a bottom up approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy. The results of hierarchical clustering are usually presented in a dendrogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the merges are determined in a greedy manner. In order to decide which clusters should be combined, a measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations is required. In most methods of hierarchical clustering, this is achieved by use of an appropriate metric, and a linkage criteria which specifies the dissimilarity of sets as a function of the pairwise distances of observations in the sets.\n",
