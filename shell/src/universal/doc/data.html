    <h1 id="Data" class="title">Data</h1>

    <p>Machine learning is all about building models from data. However, data scientists
        frequently talk about models and algorithms first, which very likely generates
        suboptimal results. The other approach is to play with the data first. Even simple
        statistics and plots can help us get feelings of data and problems, which more likely
        lead us to better modelling.</p>

    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

    <p>A feature is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.
        Features are also called explanatory variables, independent variables, predictors, regressors, etc.
        Any attribute could be a feature, but choosing informative, discriminating and
        independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in machine learning.
        Features are usually numeric and a set of numeric features can be conveniently
        described by a feature vector. Structural features such as strings, sequences and
        graphs are also used in areas such as natural language processing, computational biology, etc.</p>

    <p>Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make
        machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine
        learning, and is both difficult and expensive. It requires the experimentation of multiple
        possibilities and the combination of automated
        techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert.</p>

    <h2 title="data-type">Data Type</h2>
    <p>Generally speaking, there are two major types of attributes:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Qualitative variables:</dt>
            <dd><p>The data values are non-numeric categories. Examples: Blood type, Gender.</p></dd>
            <dt>Quantitative variables:</dt>
            <dd><p>The data values are counts or numerical measurements. A quantitative
                variable can be either discrete such as the number of students receiving
                an 'A' in a class, or continuous such as GPA, salary and so on.</p></dd>
        </dl>

    <p>Another way of classifying data is by the measurement scales. In statistics,
        there are four generally used measurement scales:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Nominal data:</dt>
            <dd><p>Data values are non-numeric group labels. For example, Gender variable
                can be defined as male = 0 and female =1.</p></dd>
            <dt>Ordinal data:</dt>
            <dd><p>Data values are categorical and may be ranked in some numerically
                meaningful way. For example, strongly disagree to strong agree may be
                defined as 1 to 5.</p></dd>
            <dt>Continuous data:</dt>
            <dd><ul>
                <li><strong>Interval data:</strong>
                Data values are ranged in a real interval, which can be as large as
                from negative infinity to positive infinity. The difference between two
                values are meaningful, however, the ratio of two interval data is not
                meaningful. For example temperature, IQ. </li>
                <li><strong>Ratio data:</strong>
                Both difference and ratio of two values are meaningful. For example,
                salary, weight.</li>
            </ul></dd>
        </dl>

    <p>Smile has four attribute types:
        <a href="api/java/smile/data/NominalAttribute.html">NominalAttribute</a>,
        <a href="api/java/smile/data/NumericAttribute.html">NumericAttribute</a>,
        <a href="api/java/smile/data/DateAttribute.html">DateAttribute</a>,
        and <a href="api/java/smile/data/StringAttribute.html">StringAttribute</a>. Many
        machine learning algorithms can only handle numeric attributes while a few
        such as decision trees can process nominal attribute directly. Date attribute
        is useful in plotting. With some feature engineering, values like day of week
        can be used as nominal attribute. String attribute could be used in text mining
        and natural language processing.</p>

    <h2 id="AttributeDataset">AttributeDataset</h2>

    <p>Most Smile algorithms take simple <code>double[]</code> as input. But we often use
        the encapsulation class <a href="api/java/smile/data/AttributeDataset.html">AttributeDataset</a>.
        In fact, the output of most Smile data parsers is an AttributeDataset object.
        AttributeDataset contains a fixed number of attributes. All attribute values are stored as double even
        if the attribute may be nominal, ordinal, string, or date. The dataset is stored row-wise
        internally, which is fast for frequently accessing instances of dataset.</p>

    <p>A data object may have an associated class label (for classification) or real-valued
        response value (for regression). Optionally, a data object or attribute
        may have a (positive) weight value, whose meaning depends on applications.
        However, most machine learning methods are not able to utilize this extra
        weight information.</p>

    <p>AttributeDataset may also contains meta data such as data name and descriptions.</p>

    <h2 id="sparse">Sparse Dataset</h2>

    <p>The feature vectors could be very sparse. To save space, <a href="api/java/smile/data/SparseDataset.html">SparseDataset</a>
        stores data in a list of lists (LIL) sparse matrix format. SparseDataset stores one list
        per row, where each entry stores a column index and value. Typically, these entries
        are kept sorted by column index for faster lookup.</p>

    <p>SparseDataset is often used to construct the data matrix. Once the matrix is constructed,
        it is typically converted to a format, such as <a href="api/java/smile/math/matrix/SparseMatrix.html">Harwell-Boeing</a>
        column-compressed sparse matrix format, which is more efficient for matrix operations.</p>

    <p>The class <a href="api/java/smile/data/BinarySparseDataset.html">BinarySparseDataset</a> is more efficient for
        binary sparse data. In BinarySparseDataset, each item is stored as an integer array, which are
        the indices of nonzero elements in ascending order.</p>

    <h2 id="samples">Sample Data</h2>

    <p>In the <code>data</code> directory, we include many open datasets,
        which are frequently used in research and benchmark. In the next section, we will learn how to
        load data in a variety of formats.</p>
