    <h1 id="vector-quantization-top" class="title">Vector Quantization</h1>

    <p>Originally used for data compression, Vector quantization (VQ)
        allows the modeling of probability density functions by
        the distribution of prototype vectors. It works by dividing a large set of points
        (vectors) into groups having approximately the same number of
        points closest to them. Each group is represented by its centroid
        point, as in K-Means and some other clustering algorithms.
        Because of this reason, the algorithm discussed in this section are
        in the same package of clustering algorithms.</p>

    <p>Vector quantization is is based on the competitive learning paradigm,
        and also closely related to sparse coding models
        used in deep learning algorithms such as autoencoder.</p>

    <h2 id="som">Self-Organizing Map</h2>

    <p>A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a unsupervised learning method to produce
        a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) discretized representation
        (called a map) of the input space of the training samples. The model was
        first described as an artificial neural network by Teuvo Kohonen, and is
        sometimes called a Kohonen map.</p>

    <p>While it is typical to consider SOMs as related to feed-forward networks where
        the nodes are visualized as being attached, this type of architecture is
        fundamentally different in arrangement and motivation because SOMs use a
        neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input
        space. This makes SOMs useful for visualizing low-dimensional views of
        high-dimensional data, akin to multi-dimensional scaling.</p>

    <p>An SOM consists of components called nodes or neurons.
        Associated with each node is a weight vector of the same dimension as
        the input data vectors and a position in the map space. The usual arrangement
        of nodes is a regular spacing in a hexagonal or rectangular grid. During the (iterative) learning,
        the input vectors are compared to the weight vector of each neuron. Neurons
        who most closely match the input are known as the best match unit (BMU) of
        the system. The weight vector of the BMU and those of nearby neurons are
        adjusted to be closer to the input vector by a certain step size.</p>

    <p>There are two ways to interpret a SOM. Because in the training phase weights
        of the whole neighborhood are moved in the same direction, similar items
        tend to excite adjacent neurons. Therefore, SOM forms a semantic map where
        similar samples are mapped close together and dissimilar apart.
        The other way is to think of neuronal weights as pointers to the input space.
        They form a discrete approximation of the distribution of training samples.
        More neurons point to regions with high training sample concentration and
        fewer where the samples are scarce.</p>

    <p>SOM may be considered a nonlinear generalization of PCA.
        It has been shown, using both artificial and real
        geophysical data, that SOM has many advantages over the conventional feature
        extraction methods such as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) or PCA.</p>

    <p>It has been shown that while SOMs with a small number of nodes behave in a
        way that is similar to K-means. However, larger SOMs rearrange data
        in a way that is fundamentally topological in character and display properties
        which are emergent. Therefore, large maps are preferable to smaller ones.
        In maps consisting of thousands of nodes, it is possible to perform cluster
        operations on the map itself.</p>

    <p>A common way to display SOMs is the heat map of U-matrix. The U-matrix value
        of a particular node is the minimum/maximum/average distance between the node
        and its closest neighbors. In a rectangular grid for instance, we might
        consider the closest 4 or 8 nodes.</p>

    <p>To visualize the clustering results, we apply hierarchical clustering

    <p>The clustering results can be visualized by a hendroagram, which
        is a tree diagram to illustrate the arrangement

    <h2 id="neural-gas">Neural Gas</h2>

    <p>The Neural Gas algorithm is inspired
        by the Self-Organizing Map for finding optimal data representations based on
        feature vectors. The algorithm was coined "Neural Gas" because of the
        dynamics of the feature vectors during the adaptation process, which
        distribute themselves like a gas within the data space. Although it is mainly
        applied where data compression or vector quantization is an issue,
        it is also used for cluster analysis as a robustly converging alternative to
        the k-means clustering.</p>

    <p>Compared to SOM, neural gas has no topology of a fixed dimensionality
        (in fact, no topology at all). For each input signal during learning, the
        neural gas algorithm sorts the neurons of the network according to the
        distance of their reference vectors to the input signal. Based on this
        "rank order", neurons are adapted based on the adaptation strength that are
       decreased according to a fixed schedule.</p>

    <p>The adaptation step of the Neural Gas can be interpreted as gradient descent
        on a cost function. By adapting not only the closest feature vector but all
        of them with a step size decreasing with increasing distance order,
        compared to k-means clustering, a much more robust convergence of the
        algorithm can be achieved.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def neuralgas(data: Array[Array[Double]], k: Int, lambda_i: Double, lambda_f: Double = 0.01, eps_i: Double = 0.5, eps_f: Double = 0.005, steps: Int = 25): NeuralGas
    </code></pre>

    <p>The parameter <code>maxIter</code> specifies the maximum number of iterations.
        If the output of K-Means is used to initialize other algorithms, a small number (says 20)
        is usually sufficient. In practice, we often run the K-Means multiple times
        and choose the best one. To do that, set the parameter <code>runs &gt; 1</code>
        (e.g. 10 ~ 20).</p>

    <p>A prominent extension is the Growing Neural Gas.
        Growing Neural Gas
        can add and delete nodes during algorithm execution.  The growth mechanism
        is based on growing cell structures and competitive Hebbian learning.</p>

    <p>Compared to Neural Gas, GNG has the following distinctions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The system has the ability to add and delete nodes.</li>

        <li>Local Error measurements are noted at each step helping it to locally
            insert/delete nodes.</li>

        <li>Edges are connected between nodes, so a sufficiently old edges is
            deleted. Such edges are intended place holders for localized
            data distribution.</li>

        <li>Such edges also help to locate distinct clusters (those clusters are
            not connected by edges).</li>
    </ul>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
    def growneuralgas(data: Array[Array[Double]], epsBest: Double = 0.05, epsNeighbor: Double = 0.0006, maxEdgeAge: Int = 88, lambda: Int = 300, alpha: Double = 0.5, beta: Double = 0.9995): GrowingNeuralGas
    </code></pre>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
        val clusters = kmeans(x, 6, runs = 20)
        val y = clusters.getClusterLabel
        plot(x, y, '.', Palette.COLORS)
    </code></pre>

    <p>K-Means works very well on Gaussian mixtures.</p>

    </div>

    <p>If the clusters are elongated, however, the results may be far from optimal.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala"><code>
        val x = readTable("shell/src/universal/data/clustering/gaussian/elongate.txt").unzip
        val clusters = kmeans(x, 2, runs = 20)
        val y = clusters.getClusterLabel
        plot(x, y, '.', Palette.COLORS)
    </code></pre>

        <div class="caption" style="min-width: 480px;">K-Means on 2 Elongate Clusters</div>
    </div>

    <p>In K-Means, the number of clusters <code>K</code> has to be supplied by the user.
        However, the appropriate number of clusters is often unknown in practice.
        Several approaches (e.g. X-Means, G-Means, deterministic annealing, etc.)
        have been proposed to handle this challenge.</p>

    <h2 id="neural-map">Neural Map</h2>

    <p>NeuralMap is an efficient competitive learning algorithm inspired by growing
        neural gas and BIRCH. Like growing neural gas, NeuralMap has the ability to
        add and delete neurons with competitive Hebbian learning. Edges exist between
        neurons close to each other. Such edges are intended place holders for
        localized data distribution. Such edges also help to locate distinct clusters
        (those clusters are not connected by edges). NeuralMap employs Locality-Sensitive
        Hashing to speedup the learning while BIRCH uses balanced CF trees.</p>
